Repository for Physics Year 3 microprocessors lab

Tasks:

    MIDWAY:
        test inversion, test lower bit carry
        add our test bits (x-1) by actual bit, if 0 then og was negative, else positive
        for negative one, proceed  with the x-1 version

        divide by delta V, etc...



ADC calculation (how many LEDs to change) (fake for now)

Write changeLED


(TAKE AVERAGE OF SAMPLES OVER TIME for ADC to eliminate noise) 
(connect 2 more photodiodes to ADC2) ... either then sum them (as photodiode not taking from further area) or take average.


Convert decoded digits to decoded number

Multiplex??


Power by solar cell ?
