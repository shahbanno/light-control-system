Repository for Physics Year 3 microprocessors lab

Tasks:


find change in ADC by one LED on
calibrate ADC reading to power meter (change settings in power meter to the wavelength of LEDs from the datasheet) 



Multiplex??
    (TAKE AVERAGE OF SAMPLES OVER TIME for ADC to eliminate noise) 
    (connect 2 more photodiodes to ADC2) ... either then sum them (as photodiode not taking from further area) or take average.


for input, make i ascii so its not 010203 as opposed to 123
